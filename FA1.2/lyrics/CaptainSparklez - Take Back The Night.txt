Closet full of secrets and skeletons, awakes but nothing's true,
I used to own a castle, now it's boxes that I have to move,
Right here in the darkness there's nothing left for me to do,
It's easier to run away but today,
Today we got to,

Cast the shadows out from sight,
A final stand, a shouting cry,
All the wrongs now turned to right,
So fight the past,
Take back the night,
And call upon the torch tonight,
To bring out all the ghosts to light,
Because at last we have to go, it's time,
To take back the night,
To take back the night,

Bridges burned and broken on different sides, we start anew,
Being chased by monsters to face head on or be consumed,
Reaching out for something grasping on to, nothing to lose,
Paybacks left too long unpaid but today,
Today we got to,

Cast the shadows out from sight,
A final stand a shouting cry,
All the wrongs now turned to right,
So fight the past,
Take back the night,
And call upon the torch tonight,
To bring out all the ghosts to light,
Because at last we have to go, it's time,
To take back the night,
To take back the night,
To take back the night,
To take back the night,

So fight the past,
Take back the night,
Take back the night,
To take back the night,
To take back the night,

And call upon the torch tonight,
To bring out all the ghosts to light,
Because at last we have to go, itâ€™s time,
To take back the night,
To take back the night,
To take back the night,
To take back the night,
To take back the night,
