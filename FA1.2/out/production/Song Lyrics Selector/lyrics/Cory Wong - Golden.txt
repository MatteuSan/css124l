Looking all around at the people I see
Everybody's living the dream
Starring in the show that we film on our phones
Taking photos for pretend magazines

I don't want silver (Nope)
Don't want the bronze (Nope)
I won't play Potsie (Nope)
I play the Fonz (Hey)
Every time I see a shining thing on the screen
I think, hey, maybe that could be me

Everybody's winning
Running after something
Golden, golden
We won't stop complaining
'Til we get that something
Golden, golden

Looking over there at the grass at your place
Wondering why it's greener than mine
While you're looking over here at my studio space
Wishing that you had that kind of time

I don't want silver (Nope)
Don't want the bronze (Nope)
I won't play Potsie (Uh-uh)
I play the Fonz (Hey)
Try to keep my head down and just not care
But then, hey, what's that over there?

Everybody's winning
Running after something
Golden, golden
We won't stop complaining
'Til we get that something
Golden, golden

Everybody's winning
Running after something
Golden, golden
We won't stop complaining
'Til we get that something
Golden
(Hey, hey, hey, yeah!)
Gimme that Grammy
Gimme that globe
I can't until we're top shelf gold
We're running, running after something
Golden, golden
